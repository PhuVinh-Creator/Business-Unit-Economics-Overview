**Customer Metrics Summary 📝:**

CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): ($1,213.97)
ARPU (Avg. Revenue Per User): ($284.36)
Gross Margin: (75.6%)
LTV (Customer Lifetime Value): ($2,115.65)

🧠 Quick Insight:

✅ LTV/CAC = 1.74 > 1 → Good! You're earning more per customer than you spend to acquire them.

⚠️ However, the optimal LTV/CAC is between 3 and 5 — this means:

You may need to either reduce CAC or increase ARPU/LTV to maximize profitability.

🔻 Reduce CAC: Optimize marketing spend, improve targeting.

📈 Boost ARPU: Upsell/cross-sell, subscription tiers, or increase prices.

♻️ Improve LTV: Increase customer retention, add loyalty programs.**
